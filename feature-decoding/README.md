# DNN feature decoding

The scripts of deep neural network (DNN) feature decoding from fMRI brain activities is originally proposed by [Horikawa & Kamitani (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15037) and employed in DNN-based image reconstruction methods of [Shen et al. (2019)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006633) as well as recent studies in Kamitani lab.

## Usage

### Decoding with PyFastL2LiR

Example config file: [deeprecon_pyfastl2lir_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml](config/deeprecon_pyfastl2lir_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml)

- To train the decoders，use the following command:
```sh
python featdec_fastl2lir_train.py config/deeprecon_pyfastl2lir_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml
 ```
  
- To decode DNN features from brain activities (prediction), use the following command:
```sh
python featdec_fastl2lir_predict.py config/deeprecon_pyfastl2lir_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml
 ```
